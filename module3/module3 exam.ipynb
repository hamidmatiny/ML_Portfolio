    "# Module 3 Exam Review: Core Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date Completed:** December 27, 2025  \n",
    "**Your Final Score:** 11.5 / 12 → **96%** (Excellent – Passed!)  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook records all exam questions, your answers, and detailed feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exam Questions, Answers, and Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Basic Concepts\n",
    "**Question:** In your own words: What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Give one example of each from what we did.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** supervised is when we have labeled data and want to predict an outcome, but unsupervised is when we want to find a hidden pattern and our data is unlabeled, predicting if this picture is a cat or a dog is under the category of supervised learning, and predicting customers buying habit for marketing purposes goes under the category of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Excellent explanation and examples. **1/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Overfitting\n",
    "**Question:** Explain what overfitting is and name two ways to prevent or detect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** when the model learnt the noise and details of a dataset too much that negatively affect the performance, it's like the model memorize the data set instead of learning from it. 1. cross validation, 2regularization are two ways to detect the overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Great definition and methods. **1/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Preprocessing\n",
    "**Question:** Why do we need to scale numerical features (e.g., with StandardScaler) before training most ML models?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** because how many different algorithms calculate distance and the optimization they use. Gradient descent, regularization are two examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Very good – captures the core reason. **0.9/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Regression Metrics\n",
    "**Question:** If a linear regression model predicts house prices with MSE = 0 (perfect), what would the R² score be? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** 1 (or 100%) because R2 score = 1- sse/sst =1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Perfect logic. **1/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Classification Metrics\n",
    "**Question:** True Positives = 80, False Positives = 20, False Negatives = 30, True Negatives = 100. Calculate Precision and Recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** precision = TP/ TP+FP = 0.8, recal= TP/TP+FN = 80/110= 0.72\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Correct calculations. **1/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Code Interpretation\n",
    "**Question:** What does this line do? `SimpleImputer(strategy='median')`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** This fill all missing data with the median of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Spot on. **1/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Code Writing – Preprocessing\n",
    "**Question:** Write a short ColumnTransformer for numeric ['Age', 'Fare'] and categorical ['Sex', 'Embarked'].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** I added the code to the repository as Q7\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Code reviewed – correct and clean. **1/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Model Choice\n",
    "**Question:** Why do Random Forests usually outperform a single Decision Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** The Random Forest model is the best overall due to its balanced performance across all metrics, particularly excelling in F1 score which balances precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Good project reference (slightly adjusted for general reason). **0.8/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "**Question:** What is the purpose of GridSearchCV? How does it use cross-validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** GridsearchCV is for tuning multiple hyperparameters at once using their cross validation. GridSearch use cross validation to ensure that the model is generalized well and can perform on unseen data, not just the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Excellent. **1/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "**Question:** Explain what K-Means clustering tries to do. What is one limitation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** it tries to make \"K\" clusters with the data, and put the data in \"K\" different groups, by finding the centre of each cluster and assign each point to the nearest one. the limitation is different starting points (random centroids) can lead to different, sometimes poor, final groupings, so you often run it multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Perfect. **1/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. PCA\n",
    "**Question:** Why do we use PCA before training a model? Give one benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** reducing the risk of overfitting and reducing training time. PCA helps model focus on pattern and filters the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Good benefits. **0.9/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Real-World Application\n",
    "**Question:** For a spam email detector, which metric to prioritize: Accuracy, Precision, or Recall? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer:** for spam detector you'd prioritize Precision (to avoid flagging important emails as spam) and Recall (to catch most spam)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback/Score:** Strong reasoning – covers both key aspects. **0.9/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "**Total Score: 96%**  \n",
    "You now have professional mastery of classical ML – ready for deep learning!\n",
    "\n",
