Professional portfolio showcasing my structured journey to becoming a **Machine Learning Engineer** at top-tier companies (Google, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Meta, etc.).

This repository follows a rigorous, progressive curriculum with hands-on projects, detailed notebooks, module exams (with scores), and production-ready code. Focus areas include classical ML, deep learning, GPU acceleration, and upcoming advanced topics like **LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection**.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Core ML**: End-to-end pipelines, evaluation metrics, hyperparameter tuning
- **Deep Learning**: Custom neural networks, CNNs, transfer learning, GPU training
- **Best Practices**: Clean code, Git versioning, reproducible Colab notebooks, detailed documentation

## How to Run

All notebooks run in **Google Colab** (free GPUs):
1. Click any `.ipynb` on GitHub
2. "Open in Colab"
3. Execute cells

## Future Highlights

- Transformer architectures and modern LLMs
- Production deployment on Google App Engine
- **Capstone: LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection** (Point clouds, KITTI/nuScenes, PointPillars/OpenPCDet)

Open to feedback and collaboration!
