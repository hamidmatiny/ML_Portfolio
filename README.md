Welcome to my **Machine Learning Engineer Portfolio**! This repository documents my structured journey toward becoming a professional ML engineer capable of building, optimizing, and deploying production-grade models.

The projects follow a comprehensive, self-paced curriculum covering foundations through advanced topics, including classical ML, deep learning with PyTorch, GPU acceleration (CUDA), MLOps, and specialized applications like **LiDAR-based 3D object detection**.

Each module includes hands-on notebooks, detailed explanations, mini-projects, and exam reviews demonstrating mastery of key concepts.

## Current Progress (as of December 2025)

| Module | Status                  | Key Topics Covered                          | Score |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|
| 1      | Completed              | Python, NumPy, Pandas, Git                  | 87%   |
| 2      | Completed (Shortened)  | Linear Algebra, Calculus, Gradient Descent, Probability | 94%   |
| 3      | Completed              | Scikit-learn, Preprocessing, Regression, Classification, Clustering | 96%   |
| 4      | In Progress            | Deep Learning with PyTorch, Neural Networks, CNNs, CUDA Intro | -     |
| 5–9    | Upcoming               | Transformers, MLOps, Deployment (App Engine), Advanced Projects (incl. LiDAR Object Detection), Interview Prep | -     |

## Repository Structure

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Programming & Tools**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch (in progress)
- **Mathematics**: Vectors, matrices, dot products, partial derivatives, gradient descent
- **Classical ML**: Feature engineering, model evaluation (Precision/Recall/F1), hyperparameter tuning, unsupervised learning (K-Means, PCA)
- **Deep Learning (Upcoming)**: Neural networks, CNNs, transfer learning, GPU acceleration
- **Best Practices**: Clean code, version control (Git), detailed documentation, reproducible notebooks

## Upcoming Highlights

- Convolutional Neural Networks on CIFAR-10
- GPU-accelerated training with CUDA in PyTorch
- End-to-end MLOps pipeline with deployment on Google App Engine
- Capstone: **LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection** (Point clouds, KITTI/nuScenes dataset, modern architectures like PointPillars)

## How to Run the Notebooks

All notebooks are designed to run in **Google Colab** (free GPU access available):

1. Open any `.ipynb` file on GitHub
2. Click "Open in Colab" badge (or manually copy the link)
3. Run cells sequentially

No local installation required for exploration.

## About Me

I'm on a focused journey to become a Machine Learning Engineer at top-tier companies (Google, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Meta, etc.). This portfolio showcases consistent progress, deep understanding, and production-ready skills.
